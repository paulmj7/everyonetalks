# EveryoneTalks

EveryoneTalks is an web app to communicate for those who cannot speak and are visually impaired. As you cycle through letters on the screen, the letters are repeated back so the user can know which letter they are selecting. This app is streamlined to be as simple as possible, with a robust user-interface that only has two buttons.

## Usage

Still a work in progress

The "Letter" button cycles through letters a-z, with options to delete a letter or to clear the screen, and then cycles back to a-z. To use the delete letter or clear screen functions, simply cycle through using the "Letter" button until the app says "delete letter" or "clear screen", and then hit the "Enter" button. A "success" message will be vocalized.

The "Enter" button confirms a letter choice so that the user can begin selecting the next letter in the word or phrase. A space can be entered by pressing "Enter" twice.
